        <h1>UAE Trip Survival Guide</h1>
        <h2>Preperation</h2>
        <p>First, and probably most important thing is to bring someform of entertainment, for example, (if you can) bring or download music, bring a nintedo switch. Or if you really wanna not get bored, bring a damn PS5.</p>
        <p>It doesn't necessesarily have to be electronics, you can bring card games like UNO or something. I do need to say that, there IS a cafeteria section in Northstar (the place we're going) but if you want, you can bring your own snacks.</p>
        <strong>VERY IMPORTANT</strong>
        <p>Please, for God's sake, if you don't want to sleep next to Sari (he literally sleeps naked) PLEASE, bring a sleeping bag.</p>
        <h2>What to Actually Do</h2>
        <p>Now that you have all the necessary items for the trip, we need to see what to actually do. I have put the trip schedule below. (this may not be 100% accurate as i am putting this from memory)</p>
        <p>7:30 - 8:30 Breakfast</p>
        <p>8:30 - 9:30 Get Ready</p>
        <p>9:00 - 12:00 Activites Start</p>
        <p>12:00 - 1:00 Lunch</p>
        <p>1:00 - 4:30 Activites Continue</p>
        <p>4:30 - 5:00 Daily Debrief and Regroup</p>
        <p>5:00 - 6:00 Free Time (this is maybe when sari starts acting sus/zesty)</p>
        <p>6:00 - 7:00 Dinner</p>
        <p>7:00 - 8:00 Evening Entertainment</p>
        <p>8:00 - 9:00 Bed (sari prob gonna act sus agin)</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I think I'm done here.</p>
